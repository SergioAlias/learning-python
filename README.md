# learning-python
Some basic code I wrote during my first Python course in early 2021.

The course had 4 modules covering the basics of Python programming and a final module that was intended to summarize all learned stuff.

Code is full of badâ€”or maybe not bad but weird?â€”programming practices but I think it is interesting to have this code uploaded on GitHub so we can remember that no one is born knowing and that you live and learn!

Feel free to roast the coding skills of my past self as much as you want ðŸ™„
